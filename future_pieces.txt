🟥 FULL CUSTOM CHESS RULESET (ALL NINE PIECES)

Pieces: Joker, Doomfist, Sniper, Sentinel, Assassin, Berserker, Catapult, Wraith, Juggernaut.

------------------------------------------
🃏 1. JOKER
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves exactly like a King (1 square in any direction).

Capture

Cannot capture anything.

Cannot block check by capturing.

Taunt — Movement Restriction Mechanic (Final Version)

For each enemy piece P:

If P has at least one legal move that would capture the Joker, then:

All of P’s other moves become illegal

P may only choose from moves that capture the Joker

P does not have to move immediately; it's just restricted

Taunt Ends When:

Joker moves out of the capturing path

Joker becomes protected (e.g., Sentinel immunity)

The capturing move would put P’s king in check

Joker dies

P becomes pinned or otherwise unable to perform that move

Notes

Snipers and Juggernauts obey taunt rules too.

A taunted piece with no legal Joker-capturing move simply cannot move that turn.

------------------------------------------
💥 2. DOOMFIST
------------------------------------------
Movement

A long-range jump piece.

May jump to ANY square offset (dx, dy) where:

dx ≠ 0

dy ≠ 0
→ Essentially a “super-knight” that jumps to any coordinate not in a straight line.

Capture

Landing on an enemy captures it.

Restrictions

Cannot capture the King.

Stun

After capturing, Doomfist becomes stunned for its next turn.

Stunned = cannot move or attack for 1 full turn.

------------------------------------------
🎯 3. SNIPER
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves exactly like a King (1 square any direction).

Attack

May attack in any queen direction (rook/bishop lines).

Must have clear line-of-sight.

Does not move when attacking.

Restrictions

Cannot shoot through pieces.

Cannot capture its own king by accident (duh).

Must respect check rules.

------------------------------------------
🛡️ 4. SENTINEL
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves 1 square orthogonally (up, down, left, right).

No diagonal moves.

Shield Line (Immunity Ability)

A friendly piece directly in front or directly behind the Sentinel
(same rank/file, adjacent or continuous line)
becomes IMMUNE to all capture.

Immunity Notes

Immunity applies only along the exact straight line of protection.

Moving the protected piece or Sentinel breaks the immunity.

Prevents:

Melee captures

Sniper shots

Wraith possession

Juggernaut crushing

Berserker chains

Catapult launches landing on them

Limits

Sentinel does not protect diagonally.

Sentinel cannot protect itself.

------------------------------------------
🗡️ 5. ASSASSIN
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves like a Queen (orthogonal + diagonal),

BUT cannot pass through pieces normally.

Stealth Jump-Capture

When capturing, Assassin may jump over exactly ONE adjacent piece (enemy or friendly)
and land on the first enemy piece behind it in the same straight line.

Example:

A = Assassin
? = adjacent piece (any)
E = enemy piece to kill

A ? E


Assassin jumps over ?, lands on E, kills it.

Restrictions

Cannot jump over two pieces.

Cannot jump without capturing.

Cannot jump over a Sentinel-protected unit.

------------------------------------------
⚔️ 6. BERSERKER
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves like a Knight (your default earlier), unless you want King movement instead.

(Tell me if you want to finalize King vs Knight.)

Capture — Berserk Mode

When Berserker captures a piece:

Berserker enters Berserk Mode

It must immediately check for another legal capture

If one exists, it must capture again

This repeats until:

No legal capture is available

Value restriction blocks further captures

Value Restriction

Berserker can ONLY capture pieces of equal or lesser value than the one it just captured.

Example:

Takes Queen → may take Rook → Bishop → Pawn

Takes Pawn → can only take Pawns afterward

Death Rule

When the chain ends (no valid capture), Berserker dies instantly.

Edge Conditions

If final capture ends on a square in check → it still dies.

Sentinel-protected pieces break the chain.

------------------------------------------
🏹 7. CATAPULT
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves like a King.

Launch Ability

Instead of moving, Catapult may:

Select an adjacent friendly piece

Choose a direction (orthogonal or diagonal, depending on your version; default = all 8 directions allowed)

Launch the piece in that line until it hits:

an enemy (which it captures and lands there), or

the first occupied square (if friendly — move illegal), or

the edge of the board

Notes

Catapult cannot launch itself.

Launched piece is considered “moving normally” for purposes of check resolution.

If launched piece lands on a square that checks the enemy king, that check is real.

------------------------------------------
👻 8. WRAITH
------------------------------------------
Movement

Moves like a Bishop (diagonal only).

Possession (Mind Control)

Once per turn, instead of moving, Wraith may attempt to possess an enemy piece.

Requirements:

Enemy must be within 3 squares along a straight line (orthogonal or diagonal).

Clear line-of-sight.

Enemy must NOT be:

A King

Sentinel-protected

Another Wraith

Effect

Target is mind-controlled for X turns (default: 3).

The enemy piece temporarily becomes part of your army and moves on your turns.

Possessed Piece Limits

Cannot capture its own King

Cannot suicide intentionally

Cannot break rules of its normal movement set

After Possession Ends

Control returns to original owner.

Piece remains on its current square.

------------------------------------------
🛢️ 9. JUGGERNAUT
------------------------------------------
Movement Direction (Primary Rule)

From its position:

Evaluate all 8 queen directions

Count the number of empty squares until the first occupied square in each

Juggernaut may ONLY move in direction(s) with the maximum count

Mandatory Max-Distance Move

Juggernaut must move to the furthest possible tile along that direction.

Cannot stop early.

🧨 Crushing Charge — UPDATED Balanced Version
If distance moved ≤ 4 squares:

Standard charge.

Juggernaut hits the first enemy piece on its path:

Kills it and stops there

If the first piece is friendly → movement is illegal

If distance moved ≥ 5 squares:

Juggernaut performs a full long-charge:

First enemy encountered → crushed, Juggernaut continues

Second enemy (on landing square) → crushed

Maximum two kills

Juggernaut stops after second kill or empty landing

Restrictions

Cannot crush friendly pieces

Cannot pass through the King (recommended, prevents dumb unavoidable checkmates)

Must still obey check rules on its own king
